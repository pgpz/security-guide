So, as you know, most Mozilla based browsers are highly secure, but not  FULLY!!!!! THIS is mainly for TOR(PLEASE, DO ALL OF about:config IF YOU ARE USING TOR. ALOT OF THESE ARE NOT DISABLED YET.), but can be used on ANY Mozilla ran browser.


Even TOR, as you know it, the privacy based browser for .onion is NOT fully secure!!!!! even with the shield on, you are NOT fully secure from Javascript & WebRTC and other things. please follow this guide closely and read what each command does.

you MUST enable all of these inside of tor if you want a full on safe browsing experience. Stuff like librewolf, firefox, icecat, you do NOT need to do all of these unless you absolutely know  you need to.

ON MOZILLA BROWSERS THAT ARE NOT TOR:

install these extensions if you are paranoid:

1: NoScript

2: uBlock Origin

3: Privacy Badger

4: DuckDuckGo

5: Port Authority

6: Trace

7: User-Agent Switcher (note: this WILL fuck up your youtube videos, youll see what i mean)


^ these extensions are VERY good if you want to avoid basic fingerprinting that mozilla does not block normally ^


======================================================================================================================

Now to the big step for your Mozilla lock down!!!!!

go to your address bar and type "about:config" (THIS WILL NOT WORK ON CHROME. SWITCH TO MOZILLA PLEASE. I WILL NOT BE GIVING A GUIDE ON CHROME BECAUSE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE UNLESS YOU UNGOOGLE YOUR SHIT. JUST SWITCH TO MOZILLA.)

inside of "about:config", follow these instructions CLOSELY as it will change your browser experience heavily. these are ALL resettable.

# MOST IMPORTANT STEP EVER IF YOU WANT TO BE SECURE 

Javascript.enabled = false ; this will disable ALL javascript inside of your browser. This will block MOST modern exploits & fingerprinting, this will stop ALOT of attacks & tracking methods.
privacy.sanatizeOnShutdown = true ; makes sure all cookies, cache & storage get deleted everytime you close your browser(especially Tor) its very important for forensic recovery & tracking. it will wipe ALL data from your browser each time its closed.

# Fingerprint Security


dom.storage.clipboardevents.enabled = false ; disables 3rd=party from accessing your local storage. blocks crosssite tracking via DOM storage
dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled = false ; prevents sites from knowing when you copy & paste, its used for tracking & info leaks
geo.enabled = false ; TURN THIS OFF!!!!!!! disables geolocation APIs. fully stops location leaks if you know what you are doing.
privacy.firstparty.isolate.block_post_message = true ; blocks postMessage crosssite communication.

# Fingerprint protection

privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing = true ; enforces screen letterboxing to make your browser size non unique. prevents tracking from window size (check on ipleak.org)
weblgl.disabled = true ; TURN THIS OFF!!!!!! leaks gpu details & enables unique fingerprinting.
weblgl.enable-webgl2 = false ; disabled WebGL2.0
media.peerconnection.enabled = false ; TURN THIS OFF!!!! disables WebRTC! can leak your IP through VPN & Tor.
dom.enable_performance = false ; prevents websites from measuring performance/timing attacks.
dom.enable_performance_navigation_timing = false ; disables timing info that is detailed. makes it difficult for sites to fingerprint you!
dom.enable_performance_observer = false ; stops websites from getting REAL TIME updates.
gfx.webrender.all = false ; turns off gpu rendering ; you can be fingerprinted by your gpu specs.
privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager = true ; hides the info about if you can install extensions or not (reduces the risk of looking unique.)

# Cookie & storage

network.cookie.lifetimePolicy = 2 ; forces cookies to expire when you close browser.
network.cookie.thirdparty.sessionOnly = true ; makes 3rdparty cookies session ONLY.
browser.sessionstore.privacy_level = 2 ; stops the saving of sensitive data

# Strict Network Control

network.http.referer.spoofSource = true ; sends a fake refer to the website you are on.
network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer = false ; prevents sending refers when going between https sites (stops leak origin data between sites.)
network.dns.disablePrefetch = true ; stops browser/tor from preresolving DNS. prevents leaking visited domains.
network.predictor.enabled = false ; disables prefetch of pages, reduces the risk of network activity & makes leak potential small.
network.http.referer.hideOnionSource = true ; prevents sending .onion domains as the refer to clearnet sites.

# Font Masking

gfx.font_rendering.graphite.enabled = false ; disables graphite font render. reduces fingerprint potential
layout.css.font-visibility.level = 3 ; limits which fonts are revealed to the site.

# Network Isolation

network.http.referer.trimmingPolicy = 2 ; only send origin in refer header.
network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy = 2 ; never send refers to 3rd party sites.
network.http.referer.XOriginTrimmingPolicy = 2 ; strips path & query sending cross-origin requests.

# Time Protection

privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision = true ; reduces JS timer resolution (prevents high resolution attacks for OS fingerprinting)
privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimmerPrecision.microseconds = 10000 ; sets the JS timer. higher, the safer!!!!

# Strict Isolation

fission.autostart = true ; site isolation, each site runs in a seperate process. leaks are HARDER!
privacy.firstparty.isolate = true ; each domain gets its own storage & cookies.

# Noise reduction

privacy.trackingprotection.fingerprinting.enabled = true ; activates anti-fingerprinting filter lists. will block all known fingerprinting users.
privacy.trackingprotection.cryptomining.enabled = true ; blocks cryptomining scripts. self explanatory

# Disable APIs that LEAK

dom.webaudio.enabled = false ; disables web audio API. can be used for fingerprinting
media.eme.enabled = false ; disables encrypted media extensions. reduces attack & fingerprinting.
media.video+stats.enabled = false ; prevents leaking video hardware decoding stats

# Lessening metadata leaks

browser.startup.blankWindow = true ; opens blank tab on startup of browser. will prevent past data tracking
browser.download.start_downloads_in_tmp_dir = true ; downloads files in a temp folder. avoids system traces thru downloads.
browser.helperApps.deleteFileOnExit = true ; deletes temp downloaded files on exit.

# Scured tracking & fingerprinting protection

privacy.trackingprotection.enabled = true ; blocks all known trackers using mozillas list.
privacy.trackingprotection.socialtracking.enabled = true ; blocks for social media trackers
privacy.annotate_channels.strict_list.enabled = true ; marks connections to trackers for better privacy
browser.send_pings = false ; disables ping requests when you click a link.

# Disabling unneeded features

browser.display.use_document_fonts = 0 ; prevents sites from using custom fonts
pdfjs.enabled = true ; enables internal PDF viewer so files arent passed onto an external program(phishing)
extensions.pocket.enabled = false ; disables pocket
browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled = false ; RELY ON YOUR OWN OPSEC! DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE WITH IT. COMMON SENSE IS THE BEST ANTIVIRUS.

# Lessening browser identifiablity 

webgl.enable-debug-renderer-info = false ; prevents stops from querying WebGL hardware details
media.navigator.enabled = false ; blocks access to webcam & mic info
dom.battery.enabled = false ; prevents battery status API which will leak unique info
device.sensors,enabled = false ; disables device sensor APIs


## Misc privacy

accessibility.force_disabled = 1 ; disables accessibility services
browser.cache.offline.enable = false ; disables offline cache.
beacon.enabled = disables beacon API! sends analytics data when you leave a site.
clipboard.plainTextOnly = true ; forces pasted text to be plaintext
extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy = false ; disables non-tor proxies inside of tor browser. will make all your traffic go through tor.
extensions.torbutton.block_disk = true ; blocks tor from writing data to disk.

# enforce HTTPs everywhere.

dom.security.https_only_mode = true ; forces all connections to upgrade tp https.
dom.security.https_only_mode.upgrade_local = true ; also forces https on localhost.
security.mixed_content.block_content = true ; blocks scripts & iframes loaded over HTTP on HTTPS pages.

# EXTRME HARDENING

webspeech.recognition.enable = false ; disables speech recog API.
webspeech.synth.enabled = false ; disables speech synth API.
media.hardwaremediakeys.enabled = false prevents sites from interacting with media keys.
device.sensors.motion.enabled = false ; disables motion sensors
device.sensors.orientation.enabled = false ; disables orientation sensors.
dom.gamepad.enabled = false ' disables gamepad API
browser.urlbar.suggest.searches = false ; disables live search suggestions
media.gmp-gmpopenh264.enabled = false ; disables OpenH264 plugin.
media.gmp-widevinecdm.enabled = false ; disables Widevine DRM support. (MAKES NETFLIX & STREAMING SERVICES BREAK. YT STILL WORKS.)
browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk = application/pdf,application/octet-stream,application/zip ; prsets the download handler for common file types. very good if you are scared of malware!



you can ALSO make a config for this called user.js inside of Tor or your Mozilla browser and use this format ::::

`user_pref("javascript.enabled", false); ` <=== use this with everything i listed above and save n it should work1 but please do all of these manually to be safe. AND turn that shield on still if ur on tor!!!
its still useful.

Thank you if you read this! I hope this can help you with your Tor browsing & regular clearnet fingerprint protection.
