i recommend these for most services, mind of you some websites these just wont work but i suggest always trying first. i have used all of these


https://temp-mail.org/en/ (for random shit)

https://pissmail.com/ (easy to setup, works on thunderbird)

https://protonmail.com (lets you create as many as u want, requires registry but no actual real data is required)

https://generator.email (for random shit, prob wont work for a lot of stuff)

https://internxt.com/temporary-email (mid tier, still decent)

https://tempmail.so/ (best for stuff like tiktok, twitter, etc)

https://www.guerrillamail.com/ (pretty good)

https://tuta.com/ (s tier tbh, allows custom domains)
